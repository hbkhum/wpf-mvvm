# 1. WPF
WPF, stands for Windows Presentation Foundation is a development framework and a sub-system of .NET Framework. WPF is used to 
build Windows client applications that run on Windows operating system. WPF uses XAML as its frontend language and C# as its 
backend languages. WPF was introduced as a part of .NET Framework 3.0 as the Windows library to build Windows client apps and the 
next generation of Windows Forms. The current version of WPF is 4.5. WPF is the engine that is responsible for creating, 
displaying, and manipulating user-interfaces, documents, images, movies, and media in Windows 7 and later Windows operating 
systems. WPF is a set of libraries that have all functionality you need to build, run, execute, and manage Windows client applications.

## 1.1 MVVM
To talk about MVVM we must be clear that they are the design patterns and perhaps more than one is asking at the moment, so we will define it below.

What are design patterns?
Design patterns are solutions for typical and recurring problems that we can find when developing an application. Although our application is unique, it will have common parts with other applications: data access, object creation, cross-system operations etc. Instead of reinventing the wheel, we can solve problems using some pattern, since they are solutions tested and documented by many programmers.

Why use design patterns?
If we want to develop robust and easy-to-maintain applications, we must comply with certain “rules”. I put it in quotes because 
although these design rules are recommended (highly recommended), they are not mandatory. We can always decide not to apply. 
Although if we do not, we must be aware of the reason for not applying them and their consequences. Design patterns 
help us meet many of these design principles or rules. SOLID, DRY programming, cohesion control and code coupling or reuse 
are some of the benefits we can achieve when using patterns.

# 2. What contain this project?
This project is able to consuming REST services(On This case I taked NetCore-Backend) besides use the MVVM 
Pattern and SOLID fundamentals and is based on  
Onion architecture for Front End


___For this project I used Abstract class, Interfaces, Generic Class, IoC and Async Methods.___
